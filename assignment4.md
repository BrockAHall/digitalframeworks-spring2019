My project is looking at voter turnout in an election alongside the margin in the previous election. I will be focusing on congressional elections in Pennsylvania from 2000-2010.

I plan on using the Secretary of State's data for these elections. 

Election historians and politcians in Pennsylvania are two types of sources I am looking into. 

Particularly notable sets of turnout vs. margin could be visualized in a line graph. 

This is timely because the 2018 midterm featured the largest turnout in a midterm election in over 100 years and the 2020 election is heating up now. 

I hope to answer, at least in this instance, if voters are correct in their beliefs about their own efficacy. Are they turning out more when they live somewhere where margins are close? This is also newsworthy because districts will be redrawn in 2021 and gerrymandering is an ongoing political issue.
