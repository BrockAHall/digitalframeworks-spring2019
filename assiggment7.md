I found that employees and students at the University of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump’s alma mater, as a whole donated more to Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign by a factor of more than 421 to 1. 

To follow up on this story, I would compare these cumulative amounts donated to past presidential elections as well as how other UPenn graduates running for Senate or Congress faired. I would like to interview some current students and faculty at UPenn to see how they feel about President Trump being their most famous alumni. 

In order to find my story I did the following: 

Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2016 campaign for people employed at “University of Pennsylvania” or “UPenn” 
I filtered to only contributions to Presidential committees 
I downloaded a CSV of this information and made a pivot table showing:

Compared Trump total to Clinton total 

Hed: Clinton Far Out-raised Trump Among Students and Faculty at His Alma Mater

Nut graf: Among students and faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump’s alma mater, Hillary Clinton out-raised the now-President by a factor of 421 to 1. 

Even Republicans who never made it to the general election like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz outraised Trump at the Ivy League school.
