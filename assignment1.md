### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* The headline promised interaction and that was delivered. However, the important information, that turnout dramatically inreased, was not in the headline. I would give it a 2 since the information was in the lead and once you read the article you understood. 
   * The focus was an increase in voter turnout across Texas
   * It was not in the headline. 
* I am going to give it a 2. I completely missed the box where you could enter the your own county to see the turnout numbers the first time I read it even though I knew an interactive part was coming. 
   * No. If the headline is about interaction then your interactive part should be near the top of the article. The first graph was not interactive which confused me. 
   * Make the entry box for the county name BIGGER.
* I am going to give it a 5. The information comes from the Texas Secretary of State. I have no reason to doubt that these numbers are innacurate. If they were, it would not be the fault of the journalists involved. 
   * The Secretary of State's data could be matched with the annual survey the census does with a sample group. They ask questions about voter turnout, though people on that survey could lie. 
   * The reporter could check with an indvidual county or polling location if something looks weird.
   * Yes, they gave a source.
   * Yes, everything was explained. 

### Objective: Quality

* The graphics were of okay quality. The interactive feature was interesting. The article was not long enough, however. I would give it a 4. 
   * The interactive county search drew me in. More information, perhaps comparing Texas to other states would be useful. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The data was presented, not really compared with another state, organized in an interesting way, and was correlated. 


### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * The graphics had a simple color scheme and looked like they belonged together. 
       * Yes, my eyes were drawn to the most important information. 
       * Orange was used to symbolize Texas, which is fairly common, especially with the Texas Tribune.
* Type (1-5)
   * 3 (make Font bigger on County Box)
*Color (1-5)
   * 4 (simple and gets the job done) 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * Yes, the added detail of seraching for specific counties was unique and made you feel like your vote mattered. 
   * 4 The idea was fresh but simple.

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * What was it?
   * Was it in the headline?
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
*Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
