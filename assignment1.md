Two Questions

Though US voter turnout is low compared to other democratic countries, it does vary some from year-to-year in national elections. Voter turnout notably increased in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. The 2018 midterms also featured an incredible surge in turnout versus pass midterm elections. All of these elections followed historically close Presidential elections. This is some bare-bones analysis based on little data, but I do wonder if close elections inspire higher turnout in a subsequent election as people realize their vote “matters”.  I think this is worth a look, and one could either look at Presidential elections back for 100 years, or focus on statewide elections on a specific state. The big question for this topic is “Do close elections inspire higher turnout in the next election?” 

Climate change will impact some communities in the US more than others. Are people in these communities more convinced of the threat of climate change? Are they more likely to support dramatic action like the Green New Deal? While it is hard to get polling information on individual communities, state-level polling on this issue can be found. One possibility is to look at how coastal states view climate change versus landlocked states. This  isn’t a perfect metric because communities can be affected by climate change in more ways than just sea-level rise but it is a start. This question could use more refining, but for now it is something along the lines of “Are states that will be impacted more by climate change more likely to support government action to combat the issue?”

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* The headline promised interaction and that was delivered. However, the important information, that turnout dramatically inreased, was not in the headline. I would give it a 2 since the information was in the lead and once you read the article you understood. 
   * The focus was an increase in voter turnout across Texas
   * It was not in the headline. 
* I am going to give it a 2. I completely missed the box where you could enter the your own county to see the turnout numbers the first time I read it even though I knew an interactive part was coming. 
   * No. If the headline is about interaction then your interactive part should be near the top of the article. The first graph was not interactive which confused me. 
   * Make the entry box for the county name BIGGER.
* I am going to give it a 5. The information comes from the Texas Secretary of State. I have no reason to doubt that these numbers are innacurate. If they were, it would not be the fault of the journalists involved. 
   * The Secretary of State's data could be matched with the annual survey the census does with a sample group. They ask questions about voter turnout, though people on that survey could lie. 
   * The reporter could check with an indvidual county or polling location if something looks weird.
   * Yes, they gave a source.
   * Yes, everything was explained. 

### Objective: Quality

* The graphics were of okay quality. The interactive feature was interesting. The article was not long enough, however. I would give it a 4. 
   * The interactive county search drew me in. More information, perhaps comparing Texas to other states would be useful. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The data was presented, not really compared with another state and organized in an interesting way. 


### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * The graphics had a simple color scheme and looked like they belonged together. 
       * Yes, my eyes were drawn to the most important information. 
       * Orange was used to symbolize Texas, which is fairly common, especially with the Texas Tribune.
* Type (1-5)
   * 3 (make Font bigger on County Box)
*Color (1-5)
   * 4 (simple and gets the job done) 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * Yes, the added detail of seraching for specific counties was unique and made you feel like your vote mattered. 
   * 4 The idea was fresh but simple.

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* The intent and focus of the article was clear.
   * The focus was "more Americans are concerend about climate change." 
   * It was in the headline. 
* The data was spread out across the article and there was only one graph. I would give it a 3. 
   * This was the not the most efficent way to navigate. Multiple graphs about the different questions asked about climate change would have been helpful. 
* I think the data is fairly accurate but it seems quite noisy. There really hasn't been much change since 2009. 
   * There isn't much change in the only graph shown which kind of undermines the headline. 
   * The reporter could also look at other polls and exit polls from recent elections. 
   * A source was provided. 
   * It was not really explained how the poll was conducted. 
   
### Objective: Quality

* I will give it a 3 for quality. The graph looks nice, but there is more inforamtion that could be in graph form and it feels like a lot of information that could back up the assertion is missing from the article. 
   * It's a newsworthy story, but more evidence would be helpful. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The data was not well presented. There was comparison with past data but it did not illuminiate anything. The organization was odd, as some of the data did not show up with later in the article. There was a correlation implied by academics but no evidence for it. 
   

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * The data looked like it all belonged together. 
       * My eye was drawn to the graph. 
       * The colors chosen were a little odd. Orange and grey does not make me think about climate change or even a basic agree/disagree idea. 
* Type (1-5)
   * 4
*Color (1-5)
   * 2 (The colors were an odd choice but I could tell what was going on.) 
   
### Objective: Creativity
   * This was a missed opportunity for a more visual and in-depth piece. The graph could have utilized the color greenn, other data supporting the poll's claim could have been introduced. 
   * Honestly, this was a fine article but the visual element was simply passable. I would give it a two.
