My data set is a collection of nationwide polls for midterm elections.

Cleaning the Data
I sorted the data by year. 
I calculated the average margin of every poll over all years. 
I added an N/A where appropriate so the data would be more readable. 
I added the actual outcomes of the elections. 

Does one party lead more often in the polls over time? 

Yes, on average, over the period surveyed, Democrats led by 1.5 percentage points. 

Does one party do better in actual elections overtime?  

Yes, on average, Democrats led by 4.3.

(These two statistics are not comparable because there are more polls for some years than others.) 

Were the large amount of polls relating to the most recent election in the dataset, 2014, accurate when averaged? 

The polls predicted the Republicans would win by 0.5 percentage points. They won by 5.7.  

Interestingly, the single polls from Gallup in the 1950’s were more accurate.  

I would want more evidence before actually writing an article about this finding, but it is interesting. 



More Polls Don’t Correlate to Higher Accuracy in Predicting Midterms 

Despite an increase in polls over the past several decades, polling averages are not any more predictive of the  popular vote for the House of Representatives in a midterm election than they were in the 1950’s.
