1. First, I found this data from a website where people bet on how much money movies will make at the box office. I decided just to work on the first tab, because there is a lot going on in this file. 
2. I realized the data was extremely fat, with over 100 columns and about 10 rows. 
3. I copied and transposed the data below the original data. 
4. I deleted the original data. 
5. I moved the new transposed data up where the old data was. 
6. I began deleting rows where there was literally no information for any of the columns to facilitate easier reading and so there aren't holes if this becomes a graph someday.  
7. I tried to enter N/A into some of the empty cells but there were equations set up that discouraged that. I abandonded this idea.
